## Key Features

### Room Booking Logic
- **Double Booking Prevention**: The API prevents multiple bookings for the same room on overlapping dates
- **Date Validation**: Ensures check-out date is after check-in date
- **Automatic Pricing**: Calculates total amount based on room price and number of nights
- **Status Management**: Tracks booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed)

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Client Role**: Can only view and book rooms, manage their own bookings
- **Manager Role**: Can create/edit/delete rooms and offers, view all bookings, manage booking statuses

### Data Validation
- **MongoDB Schema Validation**: All models have comprehensive validation rules
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are validated and sanitized

### Database Design
- **MongoDB Collections**: Users, Rooms, Bookings, Offers
- **Relationships**: Proper references between collections
- **Indexing**: Optimized queries with database indexes
- **Soft Deletes**: Items are marked as inactive rather than deleted

## Frontend Integration

The frontend should replace localStorage usage with API calls:

1. **Authentication**: Store JWT token instead of role in localStorage
2. **Rooms**: Fetch from `/api/rooms` instead of localStorage
3. **Bookings**: Create via `/api/bookings` instead of localStorage
4. **Offers**: Fetch from `/api/offers` instead of localStorage

This backend provides a complete, production-ready API for your hotel booking application with proper security, validation, and role-based access control.
